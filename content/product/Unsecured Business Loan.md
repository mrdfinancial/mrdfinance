## Unsecured Business Loan -

Unsecured loans are loans that are approved without the need for collateral. Instead of pledging assets, borrowers qualify based on their credit history and income . 

<b> Your income : </b> Lenders want to be sure that you have enough income to repay any new loans. When you apply for a loan (whether secured or unsecured), lenders will ask for proof of income. Your pay stubs, tax returns, and bank statements will most likely provide sufficient proof of income. Then, lenders will evaluate how much of a burden your new loan payment will be relative to your monthly income. They typically do this by calculating a  <b>debt-to-income ratio
